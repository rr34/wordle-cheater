## Log Output File
If you play Wordle, you will immediately recognize the value of this output: ![example log file](example-log-file.txt)  
  
## The User Interface

## TODO
- The detailed hints view with under 12 remaining does not fit on the screen and also does not appear to work properly.  
- Automatically name the log file and eliminate the input box.  
- If the user uses any key besides `return ` to navigate, in many cases will cause an error by not completing some task.
