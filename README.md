## Log Output File
If you play Wordle, you will immediately recognize the value of this output: ![example log file](example-log-file.txt)  
  
## The User Interface
The UI is very unusual. I was experimenting with keyboard-only operation and wanted to make all user inputs 'go through the clipboard.' Therefore, the flow is as follows:  
`<t>` type your guess  
`<Enter>` puts the guess on the clipboard  
`<g>` to transfer from the clipboard to guess in the program  
`<t>` type your hint  
`<Enter>` puts hint on the clipboard  
`<h>` transfer the hint from clipboard to hint in the program  
At this point, you should see an output showing the number of remaining possible solutions based on the guess and hint you entered.  
`<c>` and you will see a list of the top possible solutions based on letter frequency scoring.  
`<b>` to see a list of top next guesses ranked by the most unique hints that would be generated by the remaining possible solutions. This is the same as ranking by lowest average remaining words.  
`<l>` will show a list of words that contain the letters on the clipboard. This tool is for quickly eliminating letters in a 'very common letter combination' situation.  
Use the recommended guesses to make another guess in Wordle then repeat the steps above for your second guess and so on.  
`<s>` is used to transfer from the clipboard to practice solution and is also used for the name of the log file.  
`<a>` is used to transfer from the clipboard to practice guess and the program will show the Wordle hint based on the solution-guess combination.  
`<Ctrl-x>` to exit with log file save.
